# DrumTrainer
A drum rudiment practice app for Android

THE PROJECT ITSELF IS IN A PRIVATE REPO. THIS PUBLIC REPO HAS BEEN MADE TO GIVE A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

The app features a library of sheet music for all the drum rudiments where users can filter the rudiments by family and star their favorites.

The practice page of the app has a metrenome as well as a view of the chosen sheet music so there is no need to switch from a metrenome app to a sheet music app.

The full implementation of the app will also feature the ability to create full practice routines using the sheet music in the library which will automatically scroll to the pace of the metrenome.

The app was created using Android Studio, Java, and SQLite and uses Model-View-Controller design pattern.
